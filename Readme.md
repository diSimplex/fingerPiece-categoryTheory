# Finger Piece: Category Theory

This finger piece collects the Category Theory used in the diSimplex
projects.

Since all of the Category Theory we use is (relatively) well known, this
finger-piece provides a uniform notation, as well as collections of
references for each concept. In particular we attempt to reference a
number of good expositions on each topic.
